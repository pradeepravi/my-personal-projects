Brain Tree in Angular JS 1.5.X

Play Area for me to Bring up the Angula JS Page with Brain Tree's (Payment Gateway) Hosted Fields. 

1) Run this from a node http-server setup. Server.js has the configuration to do so. 

Note:Reason we do this is because, the BT stuff doesnt work for a file system HTML.

To get the http-server from node. Install npm and then run the below commands:
1) npm install http-server -g       

to start the file server as a remote server, go to the directory and run this command:
2) http-server .

Keep browser console on to watch the code play out!!
