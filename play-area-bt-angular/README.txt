Run this from a node http-server setup. Server.js has the configuration to do so. 

Reason we do this is because, the BT stuff doesnt work for a file system HTML.

To get the http-server from node. Install npm and then run the below commands:

1) npm install http-server -g       

to start the file server as a remote server, go to the directory and run this command:
2) http-server .

Keep browser console on to watch the code play out!!
